        My name is Sammy Cullinan and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I
        graduated from Arizona State University in 2019 with a degree in
        Biochemistry. Throughout college I always had an interest in programming
        languages and would passively learn languages like HTML, CSS, and
        Python. Following graduation and a few very small projects (i.e making a
        Static webpage with HTML and CSS), I realized that I thoroughly enjoyed
        coding and wanted to learn more. It was then I decided to pursue a
        career in web development. I was accepted into the
        University of Arizona's Coding Bootcamp where I tackled full-stack
        development and completed the course in November 2020. I am knowledgeable
        in HTML5, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ES6, Node.js,
        Express.js, MySQL, GraphQL, MongoDB, and Git. I am also familiar with
        Test-Driven-Development (TDD), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Object
        Relational Mapping (ORM), and Model-View-Controller (MVC).
