        My name is Sammy Cullinan and I am a Full Stack Web Developer. I
        graduated from Arizona State University in 2019 with a degree in
        Biochemistry. Throughout college I always had an interest in programming
        languages and would passively learn languages like HTML, CSS, and Python. Following
        graduation and a few very small projects (i.e making a Static webpage with HTML and CSS), I realized that I
        thoroughly enjoyed coding and wanted to learn more. It was then I decided to pursue a career in
        programming and web development. I was accepted into the University of
        Arizona's Coding Bootcamp where I tackled full-stack development and
        compelted the course in November 2020. I am knowledgable in HTML5,
        CSS3, Bootstrap, JavaScript, ES6, jQuery, AJAX, CDN, Node, Express.js,
        MySQL, MySQLite, and Git. I am also familiar with
        Test-Driven-Development (TDD), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Object
        Relational Mapping (ORM), and Model-View-Controller (MVC).
